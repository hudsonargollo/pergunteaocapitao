# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### Code Quality

- [ ] ESLint errors resolved (currently ignored for deployment)
- [ ] TypeScript errors resolved (currently ignored for deployment)

### Environment Configuration
- [x] Wrangler configuration validated (`wrangler.jsonc`)
- [x] Environment variables documented (`.env.example`)
- [ ] Production secrets configured
- [ ] Database bindings verified
- [ ] R2 bucket bindings verified
- [ ] Vectorize index bindings verified

### Infrastructure Readiness
- [x] Cloudflare Workers account configured
- [x] D1 database created and accessible
- [x] R2 bucket created for image storage
- [x] Vectorize index created for knowledge base
- [x] Knowledge base populated (38 chunks verified)

### Application Testing
- [x] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [x] Chat interface renders properly
- [x] Captain image displays with fallbacks
- [x] Error handling works gracefully
- [x] Character consistency system functional
- [x] Brand assets integrated correctly

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Pre-Deployment Checks
```bash
# Verify build
npm run build

# Test OpenNext build
npx @opennextjs/cloudflare build

# Verify wrangler configuration
wrangler whoami
wrangler kv:namespace list
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set production secrets (if not already set)
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --env production
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID --env production

# Verify secrets
wrangler secret list --env production
```

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
# Run database migrations
wrangler d1 migrations apply ask-the-captain-production --env production

# Verify database structure
wrangler d1 execute ask-the-captain-production --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';" --env production
```

### 4. Deploy Application
```bash
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy --env production

# Verify deployment
curl -s https://ask-the-captain-production.workers.dev/api/health
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application loads successfully
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 status
- [ ] Chat interface is functional
- [ ] Captain images load correctly
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Performance metrics are acceptable

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Metrics
- Response time: < 500ms (95th percentile)
- Error rate: < 1%
- Availability: > 99.9%
- Memory usage: < 128MB
- CPU usage: < 70%

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Cloudflare Analytics enabled
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Alert thresholds set

## Rollback Plan
- [x] Rollback procedures documented (`DEPLOYMENT_ROLLBACK_PLAN.md`)
- [ ] Previous deployment version identified
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Asset backup verified

## Sign-off

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Build process verified
- [ ] Configuration validated
- [ ] Testing completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Business Validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed
- [ ] Brand consistency verified
- [ ] Accessibility compliance confirmed
- [ ] Content accuracy validated

### Deployment Authorization
- [ ] Technical Lead approval
- [ ] Product Owner approval
- [ ] Final deployment authorization

## Post-Deployment Tasks
- [ ] Monitor application for 24 hours
- [ ] Verify user feedback
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Schedule post-deployment review
- [ ] Plan next iteration improvements

## Notes
- Current deployment ignores ESLint/TypeScript errors for build completion
- Knowledge base contains 38 processed chunks
- Fallback systems are in place for API failures
- Character consistency system uses reference images
